Questions

1. What do you observed based on Task 1b? How many bytes are different
between the two digests?

2. What is the maximum number of files you would ever need to hash to find a
collision on an n-bit digest? Given the birthday bound, what is the expected
number of hashes before a collision on a n-bit digest? Is this what you
observed? Based on the data you have collected, speculate on how long it
might take to find a collision on the full 256-bit digest.

3. Given an 8-bit digest, would you be able to break the one-way property (i.e.
can you find any pre-image)? Do you think this would be easier or harder than
finding a collision? Why or why not?

4. For Task 2, given your results, how long would it take to brute force a
password that uses the format word1:word2 where both words are between 6
and 10 characters? What about word1:word2:word3? What about
word1:word2:number where number is between 1 and 5 digits? Make sure to
sufficiently justify your answers.
